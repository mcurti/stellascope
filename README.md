# stellascope
A project to control the telescope via stellarium and python

Features desired (to be developed):

1. Go to functionality. The scope will slew to a desired object, the coordinates will be retreived either from stellarium or astropy.
2. The intention is to use astrometry.net to adjust the view of the scope to copensate for the errors of missalignment for instance.
